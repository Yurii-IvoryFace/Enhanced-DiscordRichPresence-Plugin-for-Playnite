# Enhanced Discord RCP for Playnite games.

**IN PROGRESS**

To use this plugin you need to create Discord App (discord.com/developers/applications), you will get Discord AppID there. 



In playnite Addons settings find "Discord Rich Presence Enhanced" and set your Discord AppID there. Now you ready to use. 
In order to get game images you need to open your Discord App (in discord dev portal), proceed to Rich Presence > Art Assets > Add Image

Images are stored at %AppData%\Playnite\ExtensionsData\7ad84e05-6c01-4b13-9b12-86af81775396\assets
(those images were generated by using your installed games metadata, if you have installed game without any metadata filled, there will be a placeholder)

Now start your game and enjoy your better presence. (better than orig playnite presence :P )

If presence not setting up, try to reload Playnite (Alt+Q), also check if your Discord AppID is correct.
